Understanding consumer behavior is key across all industries and relevant in regions. It allows businesses/organizations to answer questions such as if existing customer would likely buy a new product we developing in R&D? Or, it can answer consumer purchasing frequencies throughout the year? Thus, clustering observations into groups/segments has a powerful effect on how business operate. Further there are two general priorities businesses need to do: what individuals segments belong together and 2) how do we group them together.^[https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/hierarchical-clustering-in-r]

In terms of wholesale, we can see what groups of people are buying in bulk at a wholesale people.

The objective of doing this project is to ascertain what commodities are in high demand. By identifying such commodities local and state government can plan initiatives to store and prevent inflation thereby lowering the burden on the end-user consumer.  

1) FRESH: annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous);
2) MILK: annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous);
3) GROCERY: annual spending (m.u.)on grocery products (Continuous);
4) FROZEN: annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)
5) DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
6) DELICATESSEN: annual spending (m.u.)on and delicatessen products (Continuous);
7) CHANNEL: customersâ€™ Channel - Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/CafÃ©) or Retail channel (Nominal)
8) REGION: customersâ€™ Region â€“ Lisnon, Oporto or Other (Nominal)


## Loading the Libraries
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(dendextend)

```



## Loading the Data
```{r}
#load csv file from the UCI website and store it into an object
data_orig <- read.csv('Wholesale customers data.csv')

#view first few rows of the data
head(data_orig)
```
## Cleaning the Data
```{r}
#make a copy
data <- data_orig

#make the columns to lowercase
data <- janitor::clean_names(data)

#get rid of the categorical variables since clustering deals with continuous variables
data <- data[,-c(1,2)]

#change column names to something shorter
colnames(data) <- c("fres", "milk", "groc", "fro", "depa", "deli")
```

```{r}
#check for NAs
sum(is.na(data))

#check for blanks
sum(data =='')

# one more check for blanks
which(data =='', arr.ind=TRUE)

#one last check
summary(data)
```
Great we see there are no characters or letters in our dataset since having one would throw off the summary function.

## Clustering

Hierarchical clustering treats each observation as distinct cluster, also called **agglomerative**. Then it 1) merges two clusters closest together (via distance) and 2) merges those clusters together and repeats thsu process until all clusters are merged as one.

</center>
The main output is a **dendrogram**that shows the relationship between clusters.

</center>
The distance between two clusters is based on the **Euclidean distance**. In order to use it the observation features must be continuous and thus have numeric values.

### Applications

### Pros

* Easy to understand and implement
* Works relatively well on small data sets
* Do not have to indicate any particular number of clusters (cut at appropiate levels such as whole vs average

### Cons

* Does not work well with large datasets. This is an issue because many business and organizational datasets tend to be large >100K and visually condensing is difficult. 
* Computatonal demanding. 

```{r}
#normalize the data and put into a new object
# 2 is for the columns (1 is for rows)
data_mean <- apply(data, 2, mean)
data_sd <- apply(data, 2, sd)
data_norm <-scale(data, data_mean, data_sd)

#calc Euclidean Distance
distance <- dist(data_norm)
```

```{r}
#cluster dendrogram with complete linkage
data_hcc <-hclust(distance)

plot(data_hcc)
```

Each observation is treated as a single cluster and they are group with the nearest observation and they form a cluster. Then that cluster finds anothre observation and they form another cluster. This process repeats til you reach all observation form 1 cluster. In our case, when the Height=20. This is a **"Complete Linkage"**.

Let' try the average.
```{r}
#cluster Dendrogram with average linkage
data_hca <- hclust(distance, method='average')
plot(data_hca, hang= -1, cex=0.5)
```

OK, moving forward let's move on with average.

Let's find another way to visualize.
```{r}
library(ape)
plot(as.phylo(data_hca), type = 'fan')
```

Let's cut the tree by choosing k. I will use the average instead of the complete. Since the height is alight above 15, I will choose k to be 2 since during EDA I found 2 clusters in the scatterplot detergent vs delicacy spending. 
```{r}
#create dendrogram object
data_hca_object <- as.dendrogram(data_hca)

#color
data_hca_object_dend <-color_branches(data_hca_object, h=2)
plot(data_hca_object_dend,
     leaflab = 'none',
     ylab = 'Height',
     xlab = 'Clusters',
     main = 'Custering Wholesale Customers') +
  abline(h = 2, lty = 2)
```

```{r}
plot(cut(data_hca_object_dend, h=10)$upper)

plot(cut(data_hca_object_dend, h=8)$upper)

plot(cut(data_hca_object_dend, h=6)$upper)

plot(cut(data_hca_object_dend, h=2)$upper)

```
